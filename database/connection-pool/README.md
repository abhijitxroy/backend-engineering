# Database Connection Pool

Database connection pool concepts and backend engineering discussions organized for scalable backend systems and production engineering scenarios.

## Connection Pool Fundamentals

Coverage:

- Database Connection Pool
- Connection Lifecycle
- Pool Initialization
- Pool Sizing
- Connection Reuse
- Connection Timeout
- Idle Connection Handling
- Pool Exhaustion
- Connection Leak
- Performance Optimization

## What is Connection Pool

Connection pool maintains reusable database connections.

Instead of creating new connection for every request:

```text
Application

↓

Connection Pool

↓

Reusable Database Connections

↓

Database
```

Benefits:

- Reduced latency
- Faster response time
- Lower database overhead
- Better scalability

## Why Connection Pool Required

Without pool:

```text
Request

↓

Create DB Connection

↓

Execute Query

↓

Close Connection
```

Problem:

- Expensive connection creation
- High latency
- Poor throughput

With pool:

```text
Request

↓

Acquire Existing Connection

↓

Execute Query

↓

Return Connection To Pool
```

## Connection Lifecycle

Flow:

```text
Create Connection

↓

Pool Initialization

↓

Borrow Connection

↓

Execute Query

↓

Return Connection

↓

Reuse Connection
```

## Pool Sizing

Pool size depends on:

- CPU capacity
- Database capacity
- Application throughput
- Query latency

Too small pool:

- Thread waiting
- Increased latency

Too large pool:

- Database overload
- Memory pressure

## Common Configuration

Examples:

```properties
maximumPoolSize=20

minimumIdle=5

connectionTimeout=30000

idleTimeout=600000

maxLifetime=1800000
```

## Idle Connection Handling

Idle connections consume resources.

Strategies:

- Idle timeout
- Connection validation
- Periodic cleanup

## Pool Exhaustion

Pool exhaustion occurs when all connections are occupied.

Symptoms:

- Slow application response
- Timeout exception
- Throughput degradation

Solutions:

- Increase pool size
- Optimize slow query
- Reduce connection hold time

## Connection Leak

Connection leak occurs when application fails to release connection.

Example:

Bad:

```java
Connection connection =
dataSource.getConnection();

// Missing close()
```

Good:

```java
try(
Connection connection =
dataSource.getConnection()
){

}
```

## Popular Connection Pool Frameworks

Examples:

- HikariCP
- Apache DBCP
- C3P0

## HikariCP Production Discussion

Benefits:

- Lightweight
- Faster performance
- Lower latency
- Better resource utilization

## Pool Sizing Backend Considerations

Examples:

- API throughput
- Query execution time
- Thread pool size
- Database CPU utilization

## Production Engineering Discussions

Examples:

- Pool tuning
- Connection leak troubleshooting
- Slow query impact
- Database bottleneck analysis
- Backend scalability optimization

## Notes

Connection pool tuning directly impacts backend latency, throughput and database scalability.
